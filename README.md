**Non-Intrusive-Load-Monitoring** 

This project tells us about the state of our electronic device if it's **ON** or **OFF**, I have used Random forest for classification purpose and got 95% accurate results.



This is how our data looks like, We are going to predict the state of appliance name column in given data. "Fridge" in appliance name shows the fridge is **ON** otherwise it's **OFF**
